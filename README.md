# southwest-flight-count-scraper

**Project Description**

Southwest Airlines Flight Count Data Scraper
Created by George Thompson

This data scraper will allow users to retrieve the count of available "one-stop" and "non-stop"
flights given origin and destination locations within a provided CSV file.


**File Guide**

Script: southwest-flight-count-scraper.py
Input: example-input.csv
Output: output.csv


**Additional Comments & Concerns**

Since this program was created for solely myself to complete a job, the program
was built under the assumption that the user will not make errors when prompted for information. 
Error handling was not implemented in this project for this reason.


**Running the Script**

1. place both the "example-input.csv" and "southwest-flight-countscraper.py" files into the
same folder.

2. open your local terminal and cd into the folder that you placed your files

3. Run "python example-input.csv" or run "python3 example-input.csv" (this is dependent on your OS, you need Python 3 to run this script)

4. Enter the information requested by the program. If you make any errors, press "ctrl+c" and start 
from the beginning.


**Additional Comments**
The input CSV file can be named whatever you want and contain any destinations you want
as long as you have a column header and the flights are separated by a hyphen ("-").


**WARNING**: The test CSV has a limited number of flights, so it's very possible that Southwest's site
will eventually block your IP from further running searches. If you experience issues, reduce the number
of rows in the input CSV file.
